A function created to test whether an array made up of X amount of consecutive numbers (increasing by 1) can be divided by X and equal an integer.

## Consecutive Number Checker
https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consecutive_integer
This vanilla application is a consecutive number checker for checking if the number inputted, 
and then converted to an array of consecutive numbers based on that number's value (so 4 typed in would create 4 consecutive numbers;
7 typed in would create 7 consecutive numbers) could be divided by the inputted number and result in a whole number.
